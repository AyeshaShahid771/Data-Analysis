The company needed a detailed analysis of its online food delivery service to optimize staffing, marketing strategies, and revenue generation across various cities and demographic groups.

Developed a Power BI dashboard that includes Key Performance Indicators (KPIs) to monitor performance metrics and provide actionable insights for improving operational efficiency and revenue.

Imported six tables from the database into Power BI and verified data accuracy using SQL queries and various joins on primary keys.
Corrected data types to ensure consistency and data integrity.
Connected Power BI to a local database to import and analyze data.
Created KPIs for key metrics, including:
Amount: Total revenue generated.
Quantity: Total number of items ordered.
Rating Count: Number of user ratings and average rating scores.
Order Count: Total number of orders processed.
Used DAX queries to derive insights and developed interactive visualizations.
Designed visualizations such as:
A bar chart to show the top 5 cities based on KPIs with a slicer for selecting top N cities.
Charts displaying revenue by the top 3 categories and a line chart for yearly sales trends.
Bar charts for user ratings and demographic information, including users by gender and age.
